TypeQuest

This is an adventure-style game where the user will be directed through a terminal-based gameplay experience with colourful text and interesting ASCII drawings. This game will direct the player through an exciting story with levels 1-4. The user can choose where they would like to start or follow through with the story. Remember, these levels will get increasingly more difficult! Once the user is playing the game, they will need to make choices, pick up objects, food, armour and much more to help or hurt them during the game. While playing, the player will come across various monsters that they will need to defeat with their typing speed and accuracy!
